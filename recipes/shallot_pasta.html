            <p>This pasta is all about the shallots, 
            cooked down to a bath of olive oil to a jammy, caramelized paste.</p>
            <p>Tomato paste is there for tanginess, and anchovies for saltiness, 
            but they serve more as background flavors to the 
            sweetness of the shallot.</p>
            <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup of olive oil</li>
                <li>6 large shallots, very thinly sliced</li>
                <li>5 garlic cloves: 4 thinly sliced, 1 finely chopped</li>
                <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes</li>
                <li>1 (2-ounce) can anchovy fillets, drained</li>
                <li>1 (4.5-ounce) tube or can of tomato paste</li>
                <li>10 ounces pasta</li>
                <li>1 cup parsley, leaves and tender stems, finely chopped</li>
                <li>flaky sea salt</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Head olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium high. Add shallots
                    thinly sliced garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook until
                    shallots have totally softed, 15 to 20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add red-pepper flakes and anchoives. Stir to melt the anchovies into
                    the shallots, about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add tomato paste and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring
                    constantly until the tomato paste has started to cook in the oil, 
                    about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and transfer about half the mixture
                    to a resealable container, leaving the rest behind.
                </li>
                <li>To serve, cook pasta according to package instructions in a large pot
                    of salted, boiling water until very al dente. Transfer to Dutch oven
                    with remaining shallot mixture and 1 cup of pasta water. Cook over 
                    medium-high heat, swiriling the skillet to coat each piece of pasta, 
                    until pasta is thick ans sauce has reduced, 3 to 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine parsley and finely chopped garlic clove, and 
                    season with flaky salt and pepper. Divide pasta among bowls, and top 
                    with parsley mixture and more red-pepper flakes, if you like.
                </li>
            </ol>
