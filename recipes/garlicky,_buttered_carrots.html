        <h2><img src="images/garlicky,_buttered_carrots.jpg"></h2>
        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
            <p>These carrots are cooked in fat (schmaltz, olive oil, butter),</p>
            <p>with a pinch of something spicy (red-pepper flakes, cayenne, even hot paprika),</p>
            <p>sort of half-steaming on top of each other until just tender (no mushy carrots here, please).</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup chicken fat, olive oil or butter</li>
                <li>1/4 cup olve oil</li>
                <li>Pinch of red-pepper flakes</li>
                <li>2 bunches carrots, topped removed (about 1 pound), thinly sliced into rounds</li>
                <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped or grated</li>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt chicken fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
                    Add olive oil and red-pepper flakes, if using, swiriling to
                    bloom in a bit in the butter. Add carrots and season with salt
                    and pepper. Cook, tossing occasionally, until carrots are just
                    cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Remove pan from heat, and add garlic, tossing to coat and 
                    transfer to serving bowl.
                </li>
            </ol>
